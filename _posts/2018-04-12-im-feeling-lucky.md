As I enter my seventh year in Bizzaroland (aka The Bay Area or Silicon Valley), I am extremely fortunate to join Google, and turn the page in my journal of adventures in the valley.

As you may know, Lytro has done some pioneering work in lightfields and recently, lightfield capture for VR through the Immerge camera. Over the last two years, I have been part of the development on the Immerge camera, working on probably the most interesting stuff in my life, while also learning a tremendous amount from my peers and seniors. I hope to continue doing the same, contributing to the cutting edge of vision algorithms in VR and computational photography, at arguably the best place to do so.

While I am heavyhearted that Lytro will no longer exist in its present form, I am keen to see what this work will morph into, boosted by Google's extraordinary excellence.
