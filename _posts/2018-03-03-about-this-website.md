I have received numerous questions about how this website  and blog was built. So, in response to those, here are the basic building blocks-

- The site is hosted on github-pages.
- Images and other media are in the github repo.
- The basic layouts and color schemes were coded directly in HTML.
- Pages and blog posts are generated statically via jekyll.


I did not want a bloated CMS to maintain blog posts and I especially wanted to avoid comments and "Likes" or other social media activity. I wanted a light-weight, bare bones solution which also allows me to use git-fu to control what's live on the site etc. The natural choice was to use a static generator and I ended using Jekyll. All the posts are written in just a simple .md file that jekyll parses and creates simple HTML pages.
