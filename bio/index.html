<p> I am a research professional in Computer Vision and Machine Learning. I have practical expertise in mutiview-stereo, 3D reconstruction from smartphone photos, urban scene classification, interactive techniques in computer vision and virtual reality. </p>

<p> I work as an engineer at Google in Mountain View, California. I primarily work on computer vision algorithms towards mobile camera systems. Previosly at Lytro Inc, I worked on the Immerge VR, one of the world's most advanced live-action VR capture systems at the time. Before that, I was lead engineer in the computer vision team at Hover Inc in San Francisco.</p>

<p>In my free time, I enjoy building robots like Micromouse and simulators to run them. On the weekend I enjoy my bike rides to Hawk Hill and devouring tacos at my local tacquerias.</p>
